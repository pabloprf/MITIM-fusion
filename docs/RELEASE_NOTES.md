*   💥 **NEW FEATURE**, descriptions


### Bug Fixes

*   🐛 **MAESTRO frozen TRANSP boundary crash on the 2nd TRANSP beat**: reusing the frozen boundary
    disabled the MXH projection for *all* time slices, so the machine-initialization curve (different
    point count) made `write_ufiles` fail with a ragged-array `ValueError` in any chain with two or
    more TRANSP beats. The frozen curve is now tagged per time slice and used verbatim while other
    slices are still projected onto the common theta grid; also fixed swapped `delta/zeta/z0`
    arguments when building machine structures from an overridden boundary.
