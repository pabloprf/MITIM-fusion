PORTALS
=======

The PORTALS method, described in `P. Rodriguez-Fernandez et al., Nulc. Fusion (2022) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/ac64b2>`_ consists of using Bayesian Optimization techniques to find steady-state solutions of transport codes of arbitrary fidelity.

Once setup has been successful, the following regression test should run smoothly:
